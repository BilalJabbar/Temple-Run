                    <p>
                        Temple run is a endless runner game where the player controls a running character, and the character must avoid obstacles and enemies.The underlying plot to the game is that the character, controlled by the player, steals a golden idol from temple which appears to be in a swamp. This causes the Evil Demon Monkeys to attempt to catch the player in order to get the idol back. The game begins when the player steals the idol and ends when the character is caught by the monkeys or hits an obstacle, at which point the idol is returned to the temple and the player can attempt to steal it again.

                    <center> <h3>Scope</h3></center>

                    <p>In Temple Run, the player controls either Guy. The character chosen will embark on an adventure to seek an ancient and valuable golden idol from an Aztec temple. They will not realize that the temple is inhabited by a family of demonic monkeys who want to devour them. As the game is an endless running game, there is no end to the temple; the player plays until the character collides into a large obstacle, falls into the water or is overtaken by the demon monkeys. While the character is running, the player can swipe left or right to move the character to either side of the screen to collect coins and/or avoid obstacles. There are three types of coins to be found while the character is running: gold, red, and blue. A gold coin will only add one coin to the player's total number of coins. Red coins are worth two coins, while blue coins are worth three. The coins can be used to buy and then upgrade power-ups and/or other characters. Coins can also be bought by the player through in-app purchases with payments of actual money. When the player needs to turn left or right, the touchscreen can be swiped in the corresponding direction. If the player wishes to jump over an object, the screen can be swiped upwards; if the player wishes to slide under an object, the screen can be swiped downwards.</p>
