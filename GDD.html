                        Temple run is a endless runner game where the player controls a running character, and the character must avoid obstacles and enemies.The underlying plot to the game is that the character, controlled by the player, steals a golden idol from temple which appears to be in a swamp. This causes the Evil Demon Monkeys to attempt to catch the player in order to get the idol back. The game begins when the player steals the idol and ends when the character is caught by the monkeys or hits an obstacle, at which point the idol is returned to the temple and the player can attempt to steal it again.
